# Sichuanish Language Population Estimate

## Overview

**Sichuanish** (also proposed as *Sichuanian* or *Sichuanlish*) is a distinct ethno-linguistic identity widely spoken across Western China and the greater West Pacific region. It is often misclassified under "Southwestern Mandarin" by the PRC government, but its historical, cultural, and phonological independence suggest the need for separate recognition.

## 📊 Speaker Population Estimates

| Region                         | Estimated Speakers |
|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| Sichuan (adjusted)            | ~81 million         |
| Chongqing                     | ~30 million         |
| Western Hubei                 | ~6 million          |
| Southern Shaanxi              | ~5 million          |
| Northeastern Yunnan           | ~4 million          |
| Border Regions of Guizhou     | ~3 million          |
| Diaspora (East/Southeast Asia)| ~3–5 million        |
| **Total Estimate**            | **~132–134 million**|

> Note: Tibetan-speaking zones (e.g., Garzê, Ngawa) within Sichuan (~2 million) are excluded from the Sichuanish total, although some residents may speak Sichuanish as a second language.

## 🔍 Linguistic & Cultural Notes

- **Not a dialect**: Sichuanish differs significantly from Standard Mandarin (Putonghua) in pronunciation, grammar, lexicon, and usage domains.
- **Ethno-linguistic independence**: Just as English supports multiple nations (US, UK, Canada), Sichuanish could define future sovereign or semi-autonomous entities.
- **Colonial overlay**: CCP-imposed education policies suppress the language, e.g., requiring Mandarin in primary schools (see: “Sichuan child cries over Mandarin” video on YouTube).

## 📚 Future Proposals

- Apply for ISO 639-3 code for Sichuanish.
- Promote linguistic education materials independent of PRC ideology.
- Build public awareness using X (formerly Twitter), GitHub, and YouTube.
- Support research into Sichuanish literature, oral history, and folk law.

## 🧭 Conclusion

Sichuanish is spoken by more than **130 million people**, a population comparable to or larger than Japanese, Korean, or Russian speakers. Despite this, it lacks international recognition due to CCP policies.

> **Recognition of Sichuanish is recognition of its people, their history, and their right to choose their future.**
